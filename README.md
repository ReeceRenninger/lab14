## Project: Candy/Food Delivery Service

### Author: Eva Grace Smith and Reece Renninger

### Problem Domain  

Utilizing a socket server to create a delivery service that allows a user to connect and send order requests to different restaurants that drivers would then respond to and conduct the pickup and delivery.  Upon confirmation of delivery the vendor would send a thank you message to the customer for their order.

Stretch Goals:

- Implement a standard queue
- allow users to send "tips/thank you notes" to driver after order is received (deleted from queue).
